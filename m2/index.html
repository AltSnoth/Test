  		That's the end of the song. We are always taught to be an optimist and denying that there is this beast living inside us. But without acknowledging our horrible part, we end up lying to ourself. Without knowing our dark side, we could never change our bad habit and behavior. In the other hand, believing that we are just a monster in disguise is also not true. The fact that a mother willing to sacrifice her life for her children is real. In the process of protecting her child, she might be willing to kill if that is the only option for her. Cruelty and love is like the two sides of the same coin. They are different, yet they can't be separated. The meaning of this song is to acknowledge our dark side, learn how to overcome it and strive for our bright side. Enduring misfortune while trying to find a way out of hardship. Because what makes this life worth is the happiness that we feel while enduring pain and frustration.
